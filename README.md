# Polygon Creator

## Description

Polygon Creator is a web-based tool built using Three.js that allows users to create, copy, and manipulate polygons interactively on a 2D grid. It provides an intuitive interface for users to define custom shapes and experiment with basic polygon operations.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: A white ground with a grid for easy placement of polygons.
- **Polygon Creation**: Click on the grid to place vertices and create a polygon.
- **Auto-Complete**: Automatically closes the polygon when the last vertex is near the first.
- **Copy & Move**: Duplicate existing polygons and reposition them within the scene.
- **Reset Scene**: Clear all polygons and start fresh.
- **Smooth Controls**: Pan and zoom support with Orthographic Camera for easy navigation.
